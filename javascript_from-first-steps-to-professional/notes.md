##### Just-in-time learning vs. just-in-case learning

Just-in-case learning is the type of learning you received while receiving secondary education (jr. high or high school). It's a wide breadth of knowledge whereas just-in-time learning has more to do with seeking and receiving the necessary knowledge to perform a job or skill.

##### Anjana draws an example DOM tree

![A visual representation of a DOM tree](./images/example-dom-tree.jpg "DOM Tree Drawing")

The point of the drawing is to portray how JavaScript "sees" or works with a webpage's HTML structure. It's essentially an object that has respective properties JavaScript can interact with.
