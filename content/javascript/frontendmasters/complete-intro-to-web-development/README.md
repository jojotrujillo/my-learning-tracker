## Preface

I will be focusing on the JavaScript portion of this course and the notes will be focused on JavaScript content as well since the course covers both HTML and CSS.

## Notes

### JavaScript

#### JavaScript Intro

When writing code be explicit and simple; try not to be clever and succinct. Code is for humans so consider having to go back at some point and enhancing or maintaining the code you wrote.

Camel casing is de facto variable method naming convention in JavaScript: [Snake Case VS Camel Case VS Pascal Case VS Kebab Case â€“ What's the Difference Between Casings?](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/snake-case-vs-camel-case-vs-pascal-case-vs-kebab-case-whats-the-difference/)

Jumping the gun, but JavaScript has 3 main pillars: Single-threaded execution, local memory storage, and the function call stack. Single-threaded execution means JavaScript executes code line by line, from top to bottom.
